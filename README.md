# meetup_rsvp_predictor

## Using machine learning to predict event attendence
This project aims to predict the number of 'yes' rsvps to a meet up event.

The label is the log plus one of the sum of both the 'yes' rsvps and the waiting list. The metric I used for evaluation is RMSE. Since the labels are logged though this should be thought of as RMSLE.
